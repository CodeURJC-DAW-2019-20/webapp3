### Pre-Requisites / Phase 0 📋

The name of the App Web is Swap It!

We recommend the use of Brackets to change de code of the APP Web.

**Entities**

The entities could be User Types and Second Entities.

**User Types 👨‍💼👩‍💼**

* Admin User: Each of the managers of the App Web, responsible for the control of the proper functioning of the App.

* Registered User: A person who can sell or buy something in the App Web.

* Anonymous User: A person who can only see the published information in the App Web.


**Second Entities 👕 💷 💰**

* Request: A Registered User do a request to a Admin User to upload a product. If the admin check the request and all are ok, the product will upload.

* Product: Our products are clothes and accessories which people can sell or/and buy in the App Web.

* Brand: In the database the products also grouped by brand.

* To Buy: Web App products can be bought.

* To Sell: New products can be added to be sold in the App Web.


An example of relation, is Registered User buys Product, or Registered User sells Product in the APP web.

An anonymous user that has registered it in the App Web becomes a Registered User. A Registered User after logging in can buy products, check his historical movements or upload products to sell. 


**Pictures**

The App Web must allow to upload pictures, for example, a Registered User wants to change his user avatar.

Always the uploaded product will be accompanied with its respective photo.


**Complementary Technology** 

In this moment we don't use any complementary technology, but in the future we will use it.

**Advanced Query Algorithm**

We will use a Advanced Query Algorithm to recommend products to a customer based on their previous purchases.
